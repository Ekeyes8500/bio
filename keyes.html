    <p>Hello my name is Eric Keyes and I am an aspiring Web Developer. I am originally from Philadelphia, but grew up in Cental Pennsylvania. After graduating from West Perry in 2010, I began a career in sales. While I have been relatively successful in the sales world, I decided that I wanted to do something different with my life.</p>
    <p>I've always had an interest in coding, but going to an underfunded school district, our only classes were on the old language Pascal! I'm now in a coding bootcamp program and hopefully will have a job in the field in a few months!</p>
